<p> The sister album of Evermore and often labeled as the “favorite child”,  you’re a dreamer but also a realist and are most likely the younger child. You are introverted and likely enjoy reading. There is probably at least one song on this album that you can really relate to. You would probably enjoy listening to every song on this album, but would especially like the made up love triangle trilogy “august, betty, and cardigan” but may also identify with songs such as “this is me trying’, “mirrorball”, and “mad woman”
