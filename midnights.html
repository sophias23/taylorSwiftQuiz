<p> You often find yourself staying up past midnight and maybe even 3am. While the world is quiet, you are left alone with your thoughts. Your thoughts are very layered and complex and you often don’t share your thoughts with other people. You would enjoy upbeat tracks “Lavender Haze”, “Karma”, and “Bejeweled” but also enjoy the sadder ones such as “Dear Reader”, “Anti-Hero”, and “You’re On Your Own Kid”
